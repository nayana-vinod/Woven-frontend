o	A platform for women writers to share and discuss their interests, issues, tips, etc.

We aim to provide a safe platform that offers social networking and mentoring opportunities as well as a venue where women can read and reflect about other female role models, filling themselves with confidence and with a feeling that they are not alone in their struggles.
Aspiring women get to read inspirational stories, learn from it, remain updated about new technologies and other great women.They can also share their internship experiences, about how they bagged a particular scholarship,tips for utilising college time, interviews, entrepreneurship, job and scholarship opportunities for women, anything under the sun that can help another women from a woman. 

In short, we are breaking stereotypes and barriers to bring wings to women and help them fly high and reach greater heights !
